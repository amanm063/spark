**Learning spark from a udemy course.
Although the course looks a little outdated it has covered all the basics and with the help of gemini I am able to get the latest syntax.
Will try to add comments in each file explaining complex or extra code that I have written.
Not for whole code though.
The objective is to learn spark and upload here to get a better understanding of how fast I can implement and learn things.
Please work on the installation process as it took me a long time.
Also I am using Databricks community edition.**Learning Spark with Databricks Community Edition
This repository documents my journey learning Apache Spark using a Udemy course and the amazing capabilities of Gemini for keeping the syntax up-to-date.

Project Goals:

Gain a solid foundation in Spark concepts and functionalities.
Practice implementing Spark functionalities through exercises.
Document code with clear explanations for complex sections.
Utilize GitHub to track progress and gain feedback from the community (your focus on improving implementation speed).
Current Status:

The initial setup is underway, focusing on streamlining the Databricks Community Edition installation process (contributions welcome!).
Code snippets and exercises from the Udemy course will be progressively added.
Learning Resources:

Udemy Course (https://deloittedevelopment.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-programming-in-python-for-beginners/learn/lecture/39877668#questions)
Gemini Large Language Model (https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/)
Contribution Guidelines:

Feel free to suggest improvements or provide alternative approaches to the code.

Disclaimer:

The Udemy course content might be slightly outdated, but it serves as a strong foundation for learning Spark. Gemini helps bridge the gap by ensuring the code reflects the latest best practices.
